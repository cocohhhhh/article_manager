This is an RSS reader for **LESS** information consumption and better reading habits.

# Quick Start
If you're interested in trying it out, feel free to fork this repository and deploy it on Vercel. You can easily create a new Vercel project from GitHub using [this link](https://vercel.com/new). This way, you'll have your own customized RSS reader.

# The Why Behind This Project
In today's fast-paced world, staying updated with the latest information is crucial. While Medium offers a wealth of articles, some valuable insights are scattered across various websites and personal blogs, such as [Distill](https://distill.pub/) and [Lilâ€™Log](https://lilianweng.github.io/) . I enjoy collecting insightful articles, but their true value is realized only when I read them.
This led me to question how I could cultivate a consistent reading habit. Inspired by B.J. Fogg's book [Tiny Habits](https://tinyhabits.com/), which emphasizes that "Tiny is mighty," I sought to create a tool that would facilitate this habit without overwhelming me.

I've considered RSS readers for this purpose, but my experiences with existing RSS readers often left me overwhelmed by excessive information and an ever-growing list of unread articles. Therefore, I needed a solution that would:

- Highlight truly valuable articles
- Visualize my reading habits
- Present information in a mentally manageable way (3 articles per day is good enough!)
- Allow room for exploration and serendipity in my reading journey

With these goals in mind, I designed this project to be a tool that enhances my reading experience and helps me track my progress. I hope it proves useful for you as well!
